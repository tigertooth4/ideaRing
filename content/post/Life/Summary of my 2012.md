The year 2012 has passed for almost 20 days. I&#8217;m a lazy blogger right ;-P. I really want to write something for my 2012. The reason for delay of writing was I had a math problem to solve. I was struggling a lot during the Christmas and new year holidays. I&#8217;ve been working everyday to expect a solution for the final step of the proof: matching two pieces of expressions, one was from the Laplace transform, the other was from the Eynard-Orantin recursion formula. The proof was finally finished recently!! And I was working hard with my collaborators to write a paper about this. The paper has finished and posted. It will be appeared in arXiv soon! Although we did published it later than others&#8217; who had published a proof of the same problem I was in, I&#8217;m still very happy about this ending!!

Sorry! I digressed ;-)

The year 2012 was the year of doom. However, it was the year of **miracles** for me! Let me list a few things I&#8217;ll never forget:

*   Had the opportunity to visit Prof. M. Mulase as a visiting scholar

*   Found her!! After long time searching online

*   Departure with my students, I drunk and cried

*   Met a lot of new friends, travelled a lot of places

*   Leaned how to skate on a skateboard

*   Got my second National financial support

*   Graduated from driver&#8217;s school and got my driver&#8217;s licenses

*   And of course, my first time going abroad, my first time in US

*   Learned how to cook!

There are a lot I cannot mention here! But I will write something about that privately ;-P There is also something bad! Like I&#8217;m experiencing more hair loss now! But, you know, I&#8217;m not young anyway (sounds like my boss). Let&#8217;s get over it!

So, let me summarize my experiences: keep going, keep trying! If you feel it worth a try!
