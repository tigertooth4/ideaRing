I am realizing that except for learning the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion formula, I should learn something more. I should enrich my self everyday. Noticing that currently I just reading articles regarding to the E-O recursion. I shouldn't give up my own researches and studies. So, I should continuing study following things:

more

*   The bilinear identities for extended BKP or CKP hierarch

*   The construction of Kupershmidt deformation as well as the Lax representation from the r-matrix point of vie

*   The FriCAS/Mathematica codes for calculating integrable hierarchie

*   The non-holonomic mechanics in infinite dimension

So, let's arrange time more efficiently!!
