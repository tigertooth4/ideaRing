I should noticed that for these days Tina was not happy and I should ask her why. Yesterday I was ask her to help me picking up my bike (I just hold this bike to bought). I might hurt her because my first sentence after her return was: Could you help me?

And she told me her feeling afterwards. I was really sorry about that. Well, that's the first time I know what a American girl feels even though I did use some "polite" words, but picked a wrong time....

Well it was also remind that I'm still a quite sensitive person emotionally. I'm not changed. So, two sensitive people... Time could be hard.

But I really appreciate if she could be more open and tell others about her feeling when she was under big pressure or sad. That's why we need friends.
