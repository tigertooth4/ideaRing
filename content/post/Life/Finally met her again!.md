The year 2012 has passed for almost 20 days. I’m a lazy blogger right ;-P. To be honest, the reason for delay of the summary was I had a math problem to solve. I was struggling a lot during the Christmas and new year holidays. I’ve been working everyday to expect a solution for the final step of the proof: matching two pieces of expressions, one was from the Laplace transform, the other was from the Eynard-Orantin recursion formula. The proof is finally finished today!! Although we did published it later than others’ who had published a proof of the same problem I was in, I’m still very happy to have it!!

Sorry! I digressed ;-)

The year 2012 was the year of doom. However, it was the year of **miracles** for me! Let me list a few things I’ll never forget:

*   Had the opportunity to visit Prof. M. Mulase as a visiting scholar!It was unbelievable!! I’ve got a fund to go abroad in 2010. But I was very busy in 2010 and the following year. In order to get the full certification for going abroad, I had to pass an English test first. And I was unlucky, actually I’ve tried 4 times in order to pass this test. So this cost me a lot of time and efforts. There were two professors I really want to visit. Prof. Mulase was the first one. However, I was truly nervous to introduce my self to him, because of the lack of background of his research. I’ve had a draft, but I was hesitated for sending the letter or not for a while. In the end, my student encouraged me! Being encouraged, finally I decided to send a letter immediately, with my CV. I was thinking the worst situation, but at least I’ve tried. It was in March.To my surprise, very quickly, I received a reply from M.M.. He warmly replied and said it was no problem to give me an invitation! That night, I was so exciting and awake for the whole night!! It was like my dream come true! And it was only my first attempt!

After that, I asked him from where I should start. And he gave me some paper and suggestions. In the following few months, I’ve read his paper almost everyday. But it was hard. For I’ve only read 15 pages during the next 4 months. (But I was able to read the last 15 pages in 2 weeks later when I came to US.

*   Finally met her again!

This would be the thing I want to talk about today. The following text was very lengthy and a little mess. I took several days and finally I've finished. ;-)

Time: Aug 15, 2012.

It was the exact day when I would take flight CA985 to US. My flight would take off at 4pm. Before that day, I never thought I could have any chance to meet her again. But one of my student/friend encouraged, inspired even helped me. She said if she were me, she had found her!! But I was not that brave!

Before April, she was working in a building very close to our campus. So I got the chance to meet her before. Our first met could date back to someday in April, 2011. However, it was only until Jan 19, 2012 I had the first chance to say hello to her. I remember that was a very cold day. I was waiting at the bus station for her. I knew the usual time she would appear. But that day was so strange. She didn’t appear until 9am. I thought I missed her already, probably. So I took the 419 bus for school. That will be the last day I went to school because Spring festival was very close. I was sitting in the front section of the bus. Thinking about my ex, who was said to be married, according to my friend. I was so sad because of her marriage. During that time, the bus stopped at a bus station and I saw a girl in a long, brown color hoodie coat. I didn’t realize that was her until she got on the bus and stood in front of me. I can remember that moment every well. She was looking through the window. Her hand grasp the pole of the bus. Although she was wearing gloves, she still feel cold. My heart was beating very fast. I thought I was so lucky to be able to meet her. I though I should do something, I should stand up and let her sit in my seat. I looked into her beautiful eyes. I was looking for a while. She might be noticed. She turned around and faced toward the front of the bus. I was a little disappoint. I thought I had no chance to notify her anymore. So the time was flying. A little while after, we arrived at the station. She was about to get off, so did I. At that time, I was so afraid to lost this opportunity. I thought I must be brave, even though my heart was beating crazily. So I said hello three times! And finally she saw me. She was very very surprised. I was very nervous at that time. And I said : hi, I’ve met you for several times! So… just say hello to you…I’m working here. She became calm a little bit. She said: yeah, I was working near here! That’s was our first meet. (Ok. It looks not like a summary anymore, I was talking to much about her…Ok. Let’s change the title to 2012, the year of miracle ;-P)

From that occasion, we had several meets. I had few chance talk to her. Most of the time I was just waving my hand or say hi! I remember once, we were in the same bus, she said she lost her phone which was just bought. I suggest her to listen to music by using the phone, so that she would be notified when someone wants to steal her phone. I tried to ask her phone number but she said her phone was stolen, so she doesn’t has a number. It was at the same meet, she told me her company will move to a suburb area of Beijing in April. She told me in which district her company will move to. However, that was the only information she had mentioned. Time flies fast, it was then April, I didn’t see her at the bus station again.

I was so regret of not getting the chance to know her name and mostly, I was wondering was she married or not. For if she was married, I probably need to leave her. However, the only thing I knew was her company would move to suburb, I didn’t even know her company’s name !!

Soon, my mom knew this thing. She encouraged me to ask which company she was in. She told me that was not so difficult, since I knew which building she was in. So, I asked the person working in that building, mentioned in which month there was a company moved out the building. But they don’t want to tell me exactly which company was moving out, because my reason for looking for this company was not so rational. Afterwards, I asked the securities working in the building, they told me there were several companies moved out, in particular, there was one company belongs to _China Petroleum_. All the companies were in 16~18th floor! That was my first clue, the only clue.

Afterwards, I was busy preparing my visiting affair. Until in the end of July, I feel like I had no time to miss. My student Hu encouraged me to find her! But how would I do?

After a long time searching, I felt that company should be located in the central portion of that suburb area. Because there is a collaboration project between BJ suburb government and CP. They built a lot of new buildings for business. So I decided to see that area. Maybe I can find her on the street!!!

So a few days later, just one week before my departure, I still felt hopeless anyway, however, I decided to go there, at least, to give a try. I didn’t want to be regretted. Hence, one morning, I went out from my home, took subway, along the route I’ve scheduled, heading to the suburb area. It was a long long way to go. Even riding the train, it took me one hour and a half to arrive to the suburb area. I came out from the subway station. The last some miles of road I need to take bus. It was a very hot summer morning, I stood at the bus station, waiting until one bus came…

The place I want to check out was an research institute belonging to CP. It was the appeared frequently at the very top place of several searching results. I took bus to get there. It was near noon, I saw the building. I thought maybe she would come out for lunch after a few minutes, maybe I could see her then. So I stood outside the institute, waiting there for her.

Gradually, I saw more and more people came out from the institute, they went to lunch. I stood on the sideway, watched there, waited for her appear. However, two hours passed, people who came out had already heading back. I still in the hopeless waiting.

[![Chang Ping district, where I thought she was](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0149-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0149.jpg) [![IMG_0150](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0150-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0150.jpg) [![IMG_0151](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0151-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0151.jpg) [![IMG_0152](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0152-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0152.jpg)

A half of hour later, I thought I don’t need to wait anymore, maybe she was not working there, maybe it was a wrong day…. So I planned to have lunch and return home. Riding on the train back, I was a little disappointed. Where was she? I didn’t have any clue then. Maybe I need to start-over again. I mean back to the building she was working before.

So in the next day, I entered the building, went to the 16~18 floor. To my surprise, they still empty. There were a lot of board left on the wall, indicating a company working here which was belong to CP. I asked someone from the same floor. He said the company there was belonging to CP, and the headquarter was very close to this building. I may consider contact their headquarter to get some information about where the company had moved. I was so exciting about this info. I told to my student and friend Hu.

[![The company had moved](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0153-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0153.jpg)

[![IMG_0154](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0154-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0154.jpg)

[![IMG_0155](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0155-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0155.jpg)

When I heard the last piece of news, I was pretty sure she was here before. Because one day I was riding a bus home, I saw her from the bus window. She and two of her friends were walking towards that street where the headquarter was located. I was quite puzzled why she was there. It was off work time. Maybe she wants to find a restaurant? Now I was pretty sure she was going to the headquarter and she works for CP! I dreamed about how quick I could found her! Everything seemed pretty simple then.

In the second day after I went to the building, I decided to ask someone working in the headquarter! I remember it was a very hot day! I walked there. But when I got there, I hesitated! What should I ask? I didn’t know her name! I didn’t know anything! The only thing I knew was the company has moved! So… I asked one of the security: “Excuse me. Do you know where the company moved to?” (I’ve described the company was in which building before.) The guard was pretty smart. He said: “What do you want to do? Why would you ask that?” I replied: “I want to find my friend. She was working there. But she is not for now!” The guard suspected. He said, “Ok then. What’s the name of your friend? I can check it out from the contact list!” I said: “Ok. The name…. Hold on please, I have a phone call….” I had no more idea! How could I possibly know the name?! I didn’t know anyone’s name! By that excuse, I quickly dashed. Standing in the shadow of a tree, I called my student Hu for help. She said, “Can you tell him a lie? Just randomly pick a name, or pretend to be a student who wants to have an audition at that company?!” I knew that might be a way for somebody! But I couldn’t say like that. Plus, now the guard already knew what I was going to do! I was not behaving like a student nor a man wants to find his friend. I replied: “Ok. Maybe it’s time to quit! I cannot find her anymore! Or let me search it online once again! ”

I went back to school! I said I should quit. However, I was still on that. Didn’t want to quit! I started to search in my office. Repeated every single clue I’ve seen before. Where a company should located in that suburb area, the company I’ve seen on the list of the building near our campus, the company regarding to CP….

Hu helped me searching on the internet for the information of that company. She even called the securities of the building, told them she was working for another company, searching for place to rent. But there was nothing more she could found. She searched online. There was nothing new too. But, she confirmed she found a list of companies, renting rooms in that building before. And we all focused on a company that belong to CP.

I felt I should check that place again, I didn’t want to waste my time, since I only had few days before leaving. So I think I should be back to the place and started searching again. Maybe she was there but in different building, which I was missed before.

It was already in the afternoon. I took buses from school. When I got there, it was 4 pm. I thought I would try to find out all the possible buildings related to CP. It should be relatively new, and was not a factory like building.

I was roaming around in that small town area for a very long time. Finally, I found a small institute belong to CP, and the building indicated there were a lot of companies in it. So, I sit outside the building, waiting for her.

It was almost off-work time. I saw again a lot of people walking out of the building. But no one looks like her. I was very disappointed. I called Hu, said I was very sad. I could not find her! Later, I came back.

[![IMG_0161](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0161-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0161.jpg) [![IMG_0162](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0162-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0162.jpg) [![IMG_0163](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0163-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0163.jpg) [![IMG_0164](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0164-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0164.jpg)

I started thinking there was not the place I’m looking for. Since the town was very small, and there was no building quite meet my criterion. So I googled again. I even post a question on Baidu, asking where is the company that previously located close to our campus but moved to suburb area.

I suddenly noticed in the same Baidu website, there was a people asking how to go to a place, looking like a company related to CP. And the answer was very interesting, they said the company was located outside the town, beside a highway, and that area was belonging to a project between CP and BJ government. I was quite amazed! Is it the place I was looking for? Anyway, it was the only clue I could have at that moment!

[![Notes taken by myself](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0160-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0160.jpg)

So, let’s check it out! I decided to go there. It was a long bus ride. I remember the weather is not so good. I took the route exactly follows the instruction from the website. Took the bus-got off the bus-up onto a bridge-walking on the bridge. It was really nothing in this area ( I thought). All I could see is farmers’ land, and some building under construction. “Is it here?” I wondered.

But anyway, since I was here, let’s explore that area a little bit. Off the bridge, I saw an area was fenced. And some truck drove through into the area. And some cars parked aside the road. All this indicating someone maybe work here. I thought: Ok. Let’s see what’s inside.

[![The build I found](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0210-1024x354.jpg)](http://www.xjliu.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0210.jpg)

There was no guard or security. So I walk through the fence, into the area. Soon I saw a very large building! It was very new! I thought: Wow, who knows there was a big castle in such a empty land!! It’s really look like a place she works!

As I walked closer to the building, I realized actually it was a block of buildings. They have springs, grassland in it! And a lot of buses waiting outside the building. Is it for transporting people from work?

As I approaching, I was disappointed again. How can I find a person in such a giant building? I started struggling in mind. It was a mission impossible, right? Maybe I should return home. And at least I found a place very likely!

But I’ll be regret! As I maybe so close to success! If I missed this opportunity, I’ll be no chance to see her for years!! (Because it was the day before the last day for leaving BJ!)

So I walked into the block of buildings. Walking through the grassland, I saw a basketball court. A lot of people were playing, they were very professional looking. Explored further, I saw a small park, springs, and small square. There were few people and dog playing in the square, but no other people. The whole block was very quiet.

Then what to do next? I asked myself. There was whole bunch of buildings, which building she will be in? Why not go into one building and ask? So I asked one person outside: can I use the bathroom of the building? He replied: Yes, but you must have a certificate…. So I stayed outside, just had no idea how to get into one building next. It was close to 4:30pm, I think people will be soon off-work!

I was right!! After few minutes, I saw some people began to get out of the building, some carrying notebook backpack, they all look faculties. It makes me very nervous. I didn’t know from where she could be out. So I moved to a place where I can see people out from different buildings yet I was hard to be seen by others.

I watched every individual I could see. They all heading to the place where buses were parked. Seems they will go back by riding the buses. A while later, I saw a man I was also constantly seen. He worked in the same company as her!! Oh, my god, suddenly I saw her!!

I bravely waved my hand to her from remote place. But she seemed not noticed. I felt it was an inappropriate time too. Because there were a lot of people going out and she was talking to her colleagues.

I was very sad! I could found her, but I had no chance to say hello again! Was it the end of the story? I had no chance anymore. Looking at her, she was so beautiful and elegance! Just like a few months ago… But time flied… I was tracing after her in a distance. I could and I wanted to take a picture of her, and no one would notice it. But I didn’t. I thought it was so creepy to do that. So watching her. She walked further and further, finally got onto one of the bus and, disappeared.

What could I do? I was really really sad! Watching the buses went away. I could catch it up. I lost the last chance to see her…

I called Hu. She said was there a taxi, I could catch her up. I felt that was not my way of doing things…

I said to her, at least I found her. There was a bit regret. But I could find her, that’s important. She agreed. It was really amazing. Sometimes things could be like that. But very unlikely.

I said, tomorrow I would leave BJ. So I couldn’t see her again. Unless I could see her tomorrow…

Yeah, why not came here again tomorrow? My flight would be in the afternoon. So I still had one more chance !! If I could get up really early!!!

Next day, I got up really early! But when I got there, it’s already around 8am. I saw a lot of buses already arrived. A lot of people were walked into the building. I got nervous. Oh my God, am I late? It would be too bad if she was in any of these buses. So I rushed to the building. It was a clear day. I hurried up to the Building where I saw her yesterday. There were two securities in the front of the building. I roamed around, and chose to sit beside a flag pole. This way, I could see any people goes into the building. I still worried about my late. I worried she maybe already got into the building. But, since I was there, it was no reason to go back right now. Let’s wait…

I saw a lot of people entered the building. Time was passed 8:30am. I was wondering if I was really late. I might wasted the last chance. I felt so stupid, because no one sitting there as myself. I tried to be calm down to not be focused by the security. Fortunately there was one guy waiting for delivery. I thought I was not the only one who was waiting for somebody.

It was passed 9am. So far I only saw a girl looked like her. So should I leave now. It seemed most of the people had started working. Fewer and fewer people were entering the building.

All the sudden, I saw a group of people walking towards the building. There was one guy I noticed immediately. The guy I had seen for long time, her colleague. Suddenly I recognized her!!!!!!

She was handling a badminton racket, talking to others, appearing very happy. My heart was beating faster immediately. But there was no time to hesitate! I stood up, walking towards her.

When we were closer, I waved to her. She didn’t notice immediately. But when she noticed, she was very surprise at first, then appeared to be little annoyed. She walked quicker, pretended not looking at my direction, tried to avoid seeing me.

But I couldn’t let her go this time. So I called loudly : “Hi!!” “Hello!!” I said several times. Suddenly, all the people of the group seemed noticed I was calling her. I suppose my face maybe got hot red. It was so embarrass moment. Because this time, all the people had noticed my intention. Especially the guy whom I had met a lot of times before. He started laughing. To show my confidence, I smiled to him and also say “Hi”. And said, I’m looking for her.

So she handed her badminton rackets to others. This was my first time facing her directly!! In front of many people!!

She looked so beautiful! Her smile was warm and her eyes were really beautiful! I tried to repeat my words which was repeated lots of times in my mind. But it didn’t work.

I couldn’t remember what I’ve told her exactly. The things I can remember were I told her I’ll leave Beijing for US today. I like her. But I didn’t know if she were married or not. She said yes, she was married. She was very surprised how I could find her. I didn’t interpret that in detail. But she said we could be friends.

She told me her last name was Li, she even told me her phone number. Of cause I also give her my phone number.

In the end, I gave her my favorite notebook as gift. I also gave her my card, which was prepared long times ago, and always be kept in my bag. The card was two pictures shoot by myself.

I guess I should stop here. This is almost the whole story. Of course I was very happy that day, Aug 15 2012. I called Hu, told her I’ve found! It was a miracle for me. God was really kind to myself….

Before the airplane was taking off, I sent her a message :“谢谢你！但愿我的举动没给你带来烦恼！祝你一切顺利！生活幸福快乐：）Bye!” She replied:“也谢谢你！谢谢你的一片心意，今天看到你很惊讶，你会找到更好的女孩。希望在国外一切顺利！”

UPDATE: I sent her a message again in spring festival, she also replied! But I should not interfere her life again….

Well, let’s end here. I had even more things want to say, like:

*   Had the chance to got a learn board skating

*   Got drunk for the first time in my life!

I’ll talk to you guys later about these. Peace!
