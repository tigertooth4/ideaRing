These days I was thinking to change my websites' passwords. Because I'll return to a country with no real freedom. Better passwords will protect me better. So I wants to try @goldengrape's [passwords generator](http://code.google.com/p/md5-password-creator/).

Basically, it uses md5 to transfer a preset string to another, which is considered to be the password. It is nicely done. But I still have some suggestions:

*   Don't let users know the technical detail behind the scene, for the sake of safet

*   After changing your password, remember you have changed it

*   Be cautious, always!

Note: if you want to generate passphrase that has symbols besides letters and numbers, you can uncomment the `boxbase64` statement. And set `var base64= ... _keyStr` following by whatever symbols you want (quoted from @goldengrape).
