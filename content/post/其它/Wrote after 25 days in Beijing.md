Title: Wrote after 25 days in Beijing

Date: 2013-09-09 02:52:08

When I first came back to Beijing, I was shocked as I said before. There were too many things I couldn't put up with. The most tough one to got along with, was the transportation system. People and cars were both jammed on road. Cars were definitely wouldn't keep distance with people.

As I wrote to Simon :

> Board skating is not easy in Beijing. Because cars are always occupying the bike lane. And people are everywhere. Therefore I have to choose  my route very carefully. I feel it is not easy for me to keep doing things I like. But I still want to try. The weather is terribly humid and hot when I landed in Beijing and Hangzhou. I start to miss the blue sky in Davis now...

Right now I would say I'm much better. I went to the same coffee place every day for studying. It is pricy, but I was more productive. And in this way I could see more people, more healthy than stay at home.

I got my electric piano two days ago and found it very interesting to play with. I got my fixie today. It was a beautiful and neat bike with some minor issues, like the front fork was not feeling so stable and the crankset was to close to the rare fork. Maybe one day I should fix it.

I had a lots of dating with girls I don't like very much. Hope everything would become better eventually.
