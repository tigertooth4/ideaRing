课程太多，一下听不过来，不过还是想记录一下：

1.  算法分析与设计（I) **[https://www.coursera.org/course/algo](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)**

    *   来自：Stanford Univ

    *   概述 _In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design. You'll learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. You'll learn several blazingly fast primitives for computing on graphs, such as how to compute connectivity information and shortest paths. Finally, we'll study how allowing the computer to "flip coins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures. Learn the answers to questions such as: How do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway? How come QuickSort runs so fast? What can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks? Did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers? 

    *   时长：6 周，包括练习与考

    *   先修 _How to program in at least one programming language (like C, Java, or Python); and familiarity with proofs, including proofs by induction and by contradiction.  At Stanford, a version of this course is taken by sophomore, junior, and senior-level computer science majors.   

2.  大脑与空间 **[https://www.coursera.org/course/brainspace](https://www.coursera.org/course/brainspace)**

    *   来自：Duke Univ

    *   概述： _Knowing where things are is effortless.  But “under the hood,” your brain devotes a tremendous amount of computational power to figuring out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember. The material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called "Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are", and is available for pre-order. The course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes. 

    *   时长：6 周，无期末考

    *   先修：

3.  体育和建筑空气动力学 **[https://www.coursera.org/course/spobuildaerodynamics](https://www.coursera.org/course/spobuildaerodynamics)**

    *   来自：埃因霍温科技大

    *   概述： _Have we reached the boundaries of what can be achieved in sports and building design? The answer is definitely “NO”. This course explains basic aspects of bluff body aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with application to sports and building aerodynamics. It is intended for anyone with a strong interest in these topics. Key fields addressed are urban physics, wind engineering and sports engineering. 

    *   时长：6

    *   先修：

4.  使用下一代科学标准方法来加深学生理解 **[https://www.coursera.org/course/sciframework](https://www.coursera.org/course/sciframework)**

    *   来自：莱斯大

    *   概述： _This course is designed to guide science educators towards an understanding of the Framework for K-12 Science Education and how, when integrated with the Scientific and Engineering Design Practices and Crosscutting Concepts are the basis for classroom instruction using the Next Generation Science Standards. 

    *   时长：4周
