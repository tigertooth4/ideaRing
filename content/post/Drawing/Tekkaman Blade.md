Today I drew a sketch of Tekkaman Blade, which is one of my favorite Anime character for all time. The armor is simply elegant! I didn't draw many details. I hope in future I could model it in Blender.

Today I was out for lunch with Dongtao. He is a Christian. I talked with him and one of his friend about NDE (near-death experiences). Recently I've bought a book written by a neuron-scientist about his NDE. I'm curious about how he could explain his experience from a professional way! How he could tell his experience was beyond the knowledge of neuron-sciences. And how he could 'prove' the existence of God!
