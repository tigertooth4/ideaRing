# Outline

For solids of revolution, the volume is relatively easy to find out. In section 6.1 and 6.2, we developed three method for finding volumes. The first two are based on the area of cross-sections, therefore these cases are direct applications of the formula $V = \int_a^b A(x) dx.$ The third case uses cylindrical shells for slicing, hence the formula is different. In this lecture, we look at some examples.

# Volume by Slicing — Washer Method

Suppose we are revolving a region about the $x$-axis. The region is bounded by two curves $y=R(x)$ and $y=r(x)$ (where $R(x)\ge r(x)\ge 0$ ), then the cross-section of the solid is an annual region. By using the general formula $V = \int_a^b A(x) dx$, the volume is given by 

$$
V = \int_a^b A(x) dx =  \pi\int_a^b(R(x)^2-r(x)^2)dx.
$$

Since the cross-section is an annual shape, the method is called the **washer method.**

# Volume by Cylindrical Shells

Instead of slicing a solid into slabs, we can slice a solid of revolution into **cylindrical shells.** This is useful when revolving a region defined by a *non-invertible* function $y=f(x)$ about $y$-axis (or axis parallel to $y$-axis).

## Slicing A Solid of Revolution by Cylindrical Shells

Suppose we are revolving a plane region defined by $y=f(x)$ with $x\in[a,b]$ about an axis $x=L$ (assume $a\ge L$).  Let 

$$
P:a=x_0<x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_n = b
$$

be a partition of the interval $[a,b]$ , let $c_k$ be the midpoint of $k$th subinterval $[x_{k-1},x_k]$. We approximate the region with rectangles based on the partition $P$ and height equals to $f(c_k)$. 

![Untitled](W1-S2%20Volu%20dfafd/Untitled%208.png)

![p3RevSolSlice.png](W1-S2%20Volu%20dfafd/p3RevSolSlice.png)

If these rectangle is rotated about the vertical line $x=L$, then a cylindrical shell is swept out. The partition $P$ gives a series of cylindrical shells, whose volumes are given by  (Why?)

$$
\Delta V_k = 2\pi\times \text{average shell radius}\times \text{shell height}\times \text{thickness}\\ = 2\pi\times (c_k-L)\times f(c_k)\times\Delta x_k.
$$

Then the volume for the solid $S$ is approximately

$$
V\approx \sum_{k=1}^n \Delta V_k
$$

The limit of this Riemann sum as $||P||\to 0$ gives the volume of $S$

$$
V = \int_a^b 2\pi(x-L)f(x) dx\\=\int_a^b 2\pi \times \text{(shell radius)}\times\text{(shell height)}\times dx. 
$$

Here $x$ is understand as **thickness variable**.

> **Example 1. Finding a Volume Using Shells**
>

The region enclosed by the $x$-axis and the parabola $y=f(x)=3x-x^2$ is revolved about the vertical line $x=-1$ to generate the shape of a solid. Find the volume.

![Untitled](W1-S2%20Volu%20dfafd/Untitled%209.png)

$$
V = \int_0^3 2\pi (x+1) (3x-x^2)dx = \frac{45\pi}{2}.
$$

# Summary of the Shell Method

1. Draw the region and sketch a line segment across it *parallel* to the axis of revolution. *Label* the segment’s height or length and distance from the axis of revolution (shell radius)
2. Find the limits of integration for the thickness variable
3. Integrate according to the formula.
